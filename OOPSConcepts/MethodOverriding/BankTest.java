       //And from the above example, we can also observe that we are able to access the parent class members and child classâ€™s overridden methods using the same parent class reference object.

       //n Java, we cannot assign a parent class reference object to the child class, but if we perform downcasting, 
       //we will not get any compile-time error. However, when we run it, it throws the "ClassCastException". 
       //Now the point is if downcasting is not possible in Java, then why is it allowed by the compiler? In Java, some scenarios allow us to perform downcasting. Here, the subclass object is referred by the parent class.
