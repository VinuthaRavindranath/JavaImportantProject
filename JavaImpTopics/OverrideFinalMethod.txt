The JVM has 2 choices, it can either call the original method present in the superclass or the Overridden method present in the subclass. Due to late binding, this decision is taken at run-time and not at compile-time.

Can We Override a Final Method?

No, the Methods that are declared as final cannot be Overridden or hidden. 
For this very reason, a method must be declared as final only when we’re sure that it is complete.

It is noteworthy that abstract methods cannot be declared as final because they aren’t complete and Overriding them is necessary.
Methods are declared final in java to prevent subclasses from Overriding them and changing their behavior, the reason this works is discussed at the end of this article.
The advantage of the final keyword is that it stops developers from intentionally or unintentionally changing the behavior of methods that should not be changed for security or other reasons.
