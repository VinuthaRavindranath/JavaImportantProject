Why main method is declared as Public in Java ?

main() method is declared as:

public static void main(String[] args)

If a public keyword is used for a method then that method is available in the project structure.
 The JVM looks for the main method with public keyword after which execution is initiated. 
 If the main method is not declared as public then the method is not visible to the JVM and an exception is thrown.

If private keyword is used before main method then the program compiles but at runtime exception is thrown.
