The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly. We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes. The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.

The static can be:

Variable (also known as a class variable)
Method (also known as a class method)
Block
Nested class

Java static variable
If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a static variable.

The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.
Advantages of static variable
It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).

Program of the counter without static variable
In this example, we have created an instance variable named count which is incremented in the constructor. Since instance variable gets the memory at the time of object creation, each object will have the copy of the instance variable. If it is incremented, it won't reflect other objects. So each object will have the value 1 in the count variable.

//Java Program to demonstrate the use of an instance variable  
//which get memory each time when we create an object of the class.  
class Counter{  
int count=0;//will get memory each time when the instance is created  
  
Counter(){  
count++;//incrementing value  
System.out.println(count);  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//Creating objects  
Counter c1=new Counter();  
Counter c2=new Counter();  
Counter c3=new Counter();  
}  
}  

Program of counter by static variable
As we have mentioned above, static variable will get the memory only once, if any object changes the value of the static variable, it will retain its value.

//Java Program to illustrate the use of static variable which  
//is shared with all objects.  
class Counter2{  
static int count=0;//will get memory only once and retain its value  
  
Counter2(){  
count++;//incrementing the value of static variable  
System.out.println(count);  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
//creating objects  
Counter2 c1=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c2=new Counter2();  
Counter2 c3=new Counter2();  
}  
}
