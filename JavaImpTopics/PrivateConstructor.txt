Can a constructor be marked as private contructor?

Yes, we can make constructor as private.

But when can we make a constructor as private? real time example?
When we have a class, if that class contains all static methods only the we can make the constructor as private.
We dont need an create an object becuase we can call the static methods directly.

Example : System.class
/** Don't let anyone instantiate this class */
    private System() {
    }
